We\\'ve been having this discussion for more than three centuries. Ghost is what you are, my friend. If you want a name so badly, choose one for yourself.\"\\n\"Maybe I will. Now that everyone\\'s gone back to the Tower and we\\'re still out here, I have plenty of time to consider what my name should be.\"\\n\"Can you open my file while you ponder the possibilities?\"\\n\"If you insist.\"\\n\"Thank you. Research Notes TK-48725.8. Data recovered from Freehold—Bray Landing. Kirren found an entire cache of intact data cores there. Brought them back just before the attack on the City.\"\\n\"It\\'s these little miracles that intrigue me so much... Fragments of memories, frozen in silicon and quartz, trapped in a moment that survives the end of a civilization, centuries of decay, and the predations of invading armies, only to be recovered and end up as flotsam of a second war. That this cache even managed to survive the Collapse is a wonder, and then the Red War? The probabilities of such an occurrence are…\"\\n\"Tyra?\"\\n\"Yes, Ghost?\"\\n\"Ahem. You\\'re rambling. Again. You said I should remind you.\"\\n\"Thank you. As I was saying, this data was recovered more than six months ago but is just now being decrypted—2.6 exabytes of documents and schematics have been decoded so far. At first glance, most of this was just the detritus of Bray\\'s work: review notes, payment records, memos. I did find some very interesting notes on a propulsion system design that I\\'ve already sent to Amanda, and there are some messages between the sisters that will illuminate Master Melivander\\'s work on the history of Clovis Bray.\"\\n\"But then I found something extraordinary. The records were fragmented—some files had been partially deleted—but there\\'s enough there to indicate that the Bray facility at Hellas Basin was larger than we previously thought.\"\\n\"Hellas Basin? The tourist spot?\"\\n\"The same. And while we know there was a BrayTech Futurescape there for promotional purposes— Bray even had an AI-led tour—all indications had been that if any research was done there, it was mostly for show: low-level projects creating improved cold-weather gear and the like.\"\\n\"But if these records are correct, the facility operated on a far larger scale. It could have been the site of the initial Warmind development. Perhaps even a core site for Rasputin itself. This could have been where the Warmind was born.\"\\n\"You got all that from some fragmented files? Is this going to be like the time you thought you\\'d identified a second Warmind? We spent a decade searching for Charlemagne\\'s vault.\"\\n\"I was correct about Charlemagne existing, just not about what it was. If we hadn\\'t done that research, we wouldn\\'t know anything about subminds.\"\\n\"Rahool still disagrees.\"\\n\"Rahool needs to get his head out of his engrams. This is why Guardians look for fragments of the Golden Age! We are the descendants of a lost civilization. Only by understanding what was can we understand what we are now. How the world we know came to be. And each artifact we find helps us interpret what we already know. Adds layers. New identities. We are experimenting in the laboratory of time, testing each observation through a crucible of evidence.\"\\n\"Sometimes our conclusions change. And with each shift, we learn more of where we came from. The next shift in our perceptions? It may be on Mars.\"\\n', \"In the beginning, there were five.\\nYul, the Honest Worm. Akka, the Worm of Secrets. Eir, the Keeper of Order. Ur, the Ever-Hunger. Xol, Will of the Thousands. And they were Virtuous.\\nIn time, Yul spoke truth and bargained well. Its children escaped the Fundament and spread throughout the worlds. They followed the words of the Deep and brought low many agents of the Sky. They took, and a portion of all they took was returned to the Virtuous.\\nThey grew strong.\\nIn time, Auryx learned Akka's secret. That he was stronger than the gods. That they had given their power, and in giving, it was diminished. Auryx rose up and slew Akka. He took, and he grew strong with Akka's power.\\nAfter the five became four, Yul spoke.\\nBehold my majesty. Behold my crushing might, my staggering size, my scales that shine with an oppressive gleam. \\nBehold my wings, which create winds that sweep through the stars.\\nTogether, we have called life to Fundament, and made that life thrive. Protected it from extinction. They are our hosts, and we are their strength.\\nBut we do not give. We take. For this is the struggle to exist. We are not immune. The weakest of us must give way to the stronger.\\nAnd Xol felt [fear|cunning], for it knew that Yul would in time turn its teeth to Xol.\\nBut Akka was not the only one with a secret. Xol had a pact with a forgotten child, abandoned by its father.\\nThe cursed one took a fraction of Xol's power, and in return, Xol took the heart from the child, whose name had been struck from the World's Grave. The orphan called life out of death, and fed that power to Xol.\\nTogether, they would find a new world to rule.\\nAnd the five became three.\\nI, the child become [herald|death], record these words. They are not of the Sorrow. They are mine.\\n\", 'From \"Collapse and Post-Collapse Incidents on Mars: An Examination of Ecological Changes in the Polar Regions,\" by Master Reinhart, Cryptarch \\nWe have detailed records of the expedition sent to the Moon to battle the alien race known as the Hive, the calamitous results of that assault, and the subsequent Lunar Interdiction that was lifted only after definitive evidence was found that the Interdiction had not restricted the Hive\\'s movements (Rahool et al., \"The Great Disaster: From Burning Lake to the Hellmouth\").\\nHowever, there are indications that while that event may have been the Vanguard\\'s first engagement with the Hive, Earth\\'s Moon was not the first place the Hive made contact with Human settlements.\\nGolden Age records detail an extensive network of Clovis Bray structures on Mars. The vast city of Freehold served as the Bray headquarters, but ancient mass-transit lines that lead from the remains of Freehold across the planet reveal multiple other sites, including the Clovis Bray Health Center in Skyline and an extensive Futurescape near Core Terminus, in the Hellas Basin region.\\nIt is the Futurescape facility that is of interest when considering the effects of ecological changes in the Collapse and post-Collapse eras. Although there are records that show that, just after the Traveler\\'s departure, the region had a mesothermal climate with an average temperature of 20°C, the region\\'s ecological zones today range from boreal to ice cap near the planetary pole, with harsh winds and a thick layer of ice that has made exploration in the region difficult.\\nWhat caused such a drastic change in the climate? If it were related to the cessation of Traveler energy during the Collapse, then we would have seen similar effects on other planets in the solar system, which we have not.\\nIf we cannot look to the Traveler for causation, then we must contemplate other external factors. Recovered satellite data reveals that the climate change in the Hellas Basin region was too rapid to have resulted from long-term ecological damage, as it had on Earth in the pre-Traveler era. In fact, data from Warsat J54987F122S, which crashed and was recovered near Freehold, indicates that the climate change on Mars may have happened over a matter of mere days. However, this Warsat was heavily damaged during reentry, and the data may be suspect. Until we have a secondary source for corroboration, this is mere supposition.\\nNonetheless, if we accept the data from J54987F122S, then we are looking at an external endothermic event, caused by artificial means, on a scale so massive that it altered the entire climate of the region.\\nWhy would this have happened? Our only source is J54987F122S, and if it is to be believed, an invasion of unknown biological entities, including one of massive size, was detected in the region immediately before the event. Could this have been a Collapse-era attack with a weapon of unknown origin?\\nAs of yet, Guardians have not reached Hellas Basin, and we have not had the resources for remote exploration. But if we did dig into the ice, what would we find?\\nAna,\\nTold you I remembered an article from the Mars research we were doing at Owl Sector. This could be what you\\'re looking for—if you can dig it out.\\nReinhart goes on for a few hundred pages from here—I\\'ll send the whole thing to Jinju if you\\'re interested— but his conclusions are all wrong. Because he never mentions the ONE THING that could have done this.\\nThere\\'s something in Hellas Basin. And you\\'re going to be the one to find it.\\n—Camrin\\n', \"Ikora has confirmed my fears. The ice on Mars is melting.\\nShe says it's the Traveler's Light—that when it awoke, it sent out a wave of Light that altered everything it touched.\\nI don't know what to believe. I look at the Traveler now, shining and alive, and I remember all the times I begged it to respond. To help its chosen through our trials.\\nI remember its silence. Even now, it does not speak… or if it does, there is no one to hear and understand its words.\\nIkora says that we cannot understand the Traveler, or its desires. They are too far removed from our own. But can we rely on something that doesn't understand us to protect us? Or must we protect ourselves?\\nI think we must. I have been searching the databanks—records that even the Cryptarchs cannot access—and sifting through data that the Speaker thought too dangerous to be disseminated.\\nI know what is on Mars.\\nWhat is buried beneath that ice is too dangerous to allow back into our world. It doesn't think like we do. It weighs and judges our existence in its ruthless calculations, and we don't even know what the goal is. Once, long ago, it might have been created as a tool to save Humanity. It is far more than a mere machine now.\\nAnd it is broken.\\nWhen Saladin sealed all the records relating to SIVA, he also put a lock on certain data concerning what lies hidden on Mars. We were stumbling around blindly in those days, in the wrong place and at the wrong time, calling out to something that could not respond or understand us. And Saladin let it happen, because our failures were safer than the alternative.\\nBut the locks are open now. I've studied the monsters in our past to prepare for the battles in our future. I know how to reach this particular monster before anyone else does.\\nIkora is too intrigued by the knowledge it holds to heed the dangers. Cayde is wasting his time filling the Prison of Elders. It's up to me to keep this secret buried.\\nTo keep us safe.\\n\", \"218CBI800JRS101\\nAI-COM/RSPN: ASSETS//POLARIS//IMPERATIVE\\nIMMEDIATE EVALUATION DIRECTIVE\\nThis is a POLARIS ASSETS IMPERATIVE (secured/UNDISCLOSED)\\nThis is an INTERNAL ALERT.\\nMultiple distributed Polaris axons report increased sterile neutrino patterning correlating to increase in AVGPOLARISTEMP.
